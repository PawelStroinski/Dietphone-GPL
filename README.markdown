----------------------
Knowledge of nutrition helps rationalize your diet. Dietphone is a solution for those particularly who want to know nutritional value of meals. Dietphone is accurate and calculates all types of the nutritional value, not just calories. This app is very helpful for diabetics, especially using insulin pumps.

Dietphone has a very rich, editable products database that you can search and browse by categories and add to the meal. Meals are stored in the log, where you can search and browse chronologically.

Dietphone will calculate for you: the energy value in calories (kcal), count of carbohydrates, protein, fat and CU, FPU exchangers. Dietphone will help you avoid mistakes, because it detects basic errors when you enter meals. Thanks to charts of nutritional value you can easily compare all the alternative products in a category.
